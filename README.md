1. Prepare the Expert Advisor (EA)
Make sure you have the EA file, which should have the .mq5 (source code) or .ex5 (compiled version) file extension.

If you have the .mq5 file, you will need to compile it into .ex5 using the MetaEditor (MT5's built-in editor).

2. Install the EA in MT5
Open MetaTrader 5.

Go to File > Open Data Folder. This will open the file system where MT5 stores its data.

Navigate to MQL5 > Experts folder.

Copy your EA file (either .mq5 or .ex5) into the Experts folder.

Close the folder and restart MetaTrader 5.

3. Compile the EA (if needed)
If you have an .mq5 file (source code):

Open the MetaEditor by clicking Tools > MetaEditor.

In the MetaEditor, open the .mq5 file.

Click Compile (or press F7) to compile the file into .ex5.

4. Activate the EA in MT5
Go back to MetaTrader 5.

Open the Navigator panel (Ctrl+N or View > Navigator).

In the Navigator panel, expand the Experts section.

You should see your EA listed there.

Drag and drop the EA onto a chart of the instrument (currency pair, stock, etc.) you want to trade on.

5. Set EA Parameters
After dropping the EA on the chart:

A settings window will pop up.

You can configure the EA’s parameters, like trading lot size, stop loss, take profit, etc.

Make sure the option "Allow live trading" is checked to enable the bot to place trades.

Click OK to apply the settings.

6. Enable Auto-Trading
To run the EA, make sure that AutoTrading is enabled in MT5. Look for the AutoTrading button in the top toolbar, and ensure it’s green (enabled).

If it’s red, click it to enable AutoTrading.

7. Monitor the EA
The EA will now begin trading based on its coding.

You can monitor its performance in the Terminal window (Ctrl+T) under the Trade tab or the Expert Advisors tab for logs.

8. Disable/Remove the EA
If you want to stop the EA, either disable AutoTrading (red button) or remove the EA by right-clicking on the chart and selecting Expert Advisors > Remove.
